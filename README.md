# Google Foobar Challenge 2022
This repo contains a collection of tasks from the Google Foobar challenges and my personal solutions to (some of) them. 
Folders with a number after the `.` are the challenges I got, others are collected from all around the Internet.
As of 2022, the solutions are supposed to run on Python 2.7.13.

If you landed here by accident, simply use Google to find out more about this not so secret hiring challenge!
